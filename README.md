The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles. The answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage. There are 100,000+ question-answer pairs on 500+ articles.
